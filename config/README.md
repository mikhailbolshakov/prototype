- Configs are provided by gRPS service `config`
- General configs are specified in config.yml and mapped to the `kit.config.model` struct
- Configs might be overwritten by environment variables supplied either as session variables or .env files
- Each service tries to enrich the general configs obtained from the gRpc service with its local environment variables ()
